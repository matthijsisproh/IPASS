# IPASS

This repository is created for my final individual project in my 1st year of Computer Science at Hogeschool Utrecht.

I had to make a library for hardware interfacing and an application which can run the library's code.

The library i've made includes an interface for a MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyro) module.
With this library you can measure acceleration and tilt, position.

My application includes an oldschool game called Spaceinvaders.

I really enjoyed doing this project. 

Thanks!
